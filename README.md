# Trending_videos_On_Youtube

**Trending on YouTube **
Trending helps viewers see what’s happening on YouTube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos and shorts that a wide range of viewers would find interesting. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video.

Trending isn't personalized and displays the same list of trending videos to all viewers in the same country, which is why you may see videos in Trending that aren’t in the same language as your browser. However, in India, Trending displays a list of results for each of the 9 most common Indic languages.
